\noindent
The Original Garden Care Service, Chester - Assistant - Part Time\\

\noindent
During my time here my responsibilities have varied due to the nature of the job, this ranges from assisting with set up of equipment for tree trimming to basic equipment maintenance. My time here has helped me to really improve my work ethic due to the physically demanding work and the effect poor attitude has within a small team performing that work. \\

\noindent
While working i handle smaller jobs and help the full time worker to focus on the more skilled jobs. This often includes manual labour but also help with larger jobs like tree removal. \\

\noindent
Wood Memorial Primary School, Saltney - Classroom Assistant\\

\noindent
Responsibilities included helping young students with their work while focusing on improving their reading ability, i also ran errands for other staff and supervised children. While here I improved my communication skills due to working as a member of a close knit staff as well as experiencing large amounts of responsibility due to the nature of looking after children\\

\noindent
I contributed by taking some of the work load off of the main teacher and allowing them to focus on a smaller groups of children thus increasing their time per student ratio.\\

\textbf{July 2009}

Elite PC Systems, Chester - Junior Technician \\

\noindent
During my time here i helped  repair PC's with varying problems while communicating with the public to decipher the possible problem. While working here I developed both my communication skills as well as my technical abilities due to responsibilities including the building of PC's and part swaps in already existing PC's.
I also contributed here by performing tasks such as Virus Removal, Software Installation and the general maintenance of PC's.\\
