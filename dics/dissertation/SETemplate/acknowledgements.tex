I would firstly like to thank my supervisor Dr Myra Wilson for her continued advice and technical support throughout the duration of the project, without said advice the project would not be close to the quality it currently stands at. I would also like to thank my fellow student from the Computer Science department Christopher Edwards for his continued insight on the project and his technical knowledge in times of need. 

I would also like to thank my family for their continued support  and my house mates for listening to me stress over broken code and looming deadlines. Lastly i would like to thank my girlfriend Rosie Howes for her love and support through not just a demanding project but throughout my time at University.
